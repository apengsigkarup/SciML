# SciML
Scientific Machine Learning exercises

To clone the repository files, run the following command from the command line

    git clone https://github.com/apengsigkarup

The recommended way to install the necessary code to work with and run the exercises is to install the environment using conda

    conda create -n SciML-env
    conda activate SciML-env
    conda install -r environment.yaml

In the Exercises/ directory there are some notebooks that contains selected problems for Physics-Informed Machine Learning / Scientific Machine Learning. In each exercise the task is to complete the code in all cells where '<DEFINE THIS>' is stated. The notebooks contains figures of results that was obtained in the complete solution and hence is the target to reproduce.
